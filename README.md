# 🚀 Rasheed Foundation | Next-Gen NGO Platform
> **"Bridging the gap between privilege and potential through data-driven philanthropy."**

This repository contains the source code for the **Rasheed Foundation Official Website**, developed during my **Web Development Internship (Phase 2)**. The project focuses on a "Mobile-First" architecture, high-performance rendering, and a modern "Dark Tech" aesthetic suitable for a forward-thinking NGO.

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks (Google Lighthouse)

Achieved **industry-leading performance scores** by avoiding heavy frameworks and optimizing critical rendering paths.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Core:** HTML5 (Semantic), CSS3 (Variables & Animations), JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Design System:** "Nexus" Dark Theme (Deep Navy/Emerald Green).
* **API Integration:** JSONPlaceholder (REST API) simulated for dynamic news updates.
* **Performance:** Skeleton Loading States, CSS-only animations.
* **Versioning:** Git & GitHub.
* **Deployment:** Netlify (CI/CD).

## 💎 Key Features Implemented

### 1. 🎨 "Nexus" Dark UI Theme
Moved away from traditional "boring" NGO designs to a **high-tech, trust-based aesthetic**.
* **Glassmorphism:** Used `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)` on the sticky navbar.
* **Glow Effects:** CSS radial gradients for background ambience.
* **3D Hover Cards:** Interactive cards that lift and glow on hover.

### 2. 🔄 Dynamic API Content
Simulated a Content Management System (CMS) by fetching data from an external API.
* **Technique:** `async/await` with the Fetch API.
* **Data Mapping:** Mapped raw JSON data to specific NGO initiatives (e.g., "Digital Access", "Crisis Response").

### 3. ⏳ Skeleton Loading Experience
To prevent **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** and improve Perceived Performance, I built a custom CSS shimmer animation.
* **How it works:** A gradient animation plays over empty card containers while the API fetches data in the background.

### 4. 📱 100% Responsive Strategy
* **Fluid Grids:** Used `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` for automatic layout adjustment.
* **Touch Optimization:** Buttons and nav links are sized for touch targets on mobile devices.
